## 📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is a major global health issue. Early prediction can save lives, and machine learning can play a crucial role in identifying patterns that indicate risk.

This project uses patient data such as:
- Age  
- Gender  
- Chest Pain Type  
- Blood Pressure  
- Cholesterol  
- Maximum Heart Rate  
- Exercise-Induced Angina  
- ST Depression  
- Number of Major Vessels  
- Thalassemia

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and clean the dataset  
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Train multiple ML models  
- Compare accuracy and evaluation metrics  
- Select and save the best-performing model  

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Heart Disease UCI dataset**, commonly available on Kaggle and UCI ML Repository.

**Target Variable:**
- `0` – No Heart Disease  
- `1` – Heart Disease

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
